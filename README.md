# bitcoinjs-lib

[![browser support](https://ci.testling.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib.png)](https://ci.testling.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib)

A pure JavaScript Bitcoin library for node.js and browsers. Backed by (slowly improving) testing, proven by over a million wallet users. The backbone for almost all Bitcoin web wallets in production today.

This is not the original bitcoinjs-lib that was not updated for a while. The current bitcoinjs-lib has been refactored to clean things up, add new functionality and merge improvements from the community. If you are looking for the original, it will be tagged as `0.1.3`. We will use `0.2.x` for releases based on these changes, so be sure to use the `0.1.3` tag if you need the original version.

## Features

- Bitcoin Testnet and Mainnet (production) support
- [HD Wallets](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki)
- Highly secure random private key / address generation using [window.crypto.getRandomValues](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.crypto)
- ECDSA signing and verification
- Transaction creation (pay-to-pubkey-hash), support for multisignature transactions
- A (somewhat incomplete) wallet implementation, improvements ongoing
